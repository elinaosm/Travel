        <p align="justify">Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago. The island is home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality. Exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops are some of the top attractions. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of local or far-flung cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors. Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles greet you with plenty to see and do, but you won't want to stay away from the beach for long. Enjoy amazing beach resorts and luxury resorts in any in Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many of the finest hotels and villas are right on the beach. You can also find Bali’s exciting surf spots nearby. For tranquil seascapes and sunrises, the eastern beach resorts are your best bets. These include Sanur, Nusa Dua and the remote coast of Candidasa. In Bali’s farther and lesser travelled East Bali and northern region, you’ll find some world-class diving spots with calm bays. They're home to pristine coral gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.</p></div>
